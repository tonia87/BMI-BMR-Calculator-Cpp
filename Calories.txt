The body mass index (BMI) or Quetelet index is a value derived from 
the mass (weight) and height of an individual. The BMI is defined as the 
body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally 
expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms 
and height in metres.

The BMI is an attempt to quantify the amount of tissue mass 
(muscle, fat, and bone) in an individual, and then categorize 
that person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese 
based on that value. However, there is some debate about where 
on the BMI scale the dividing lines between categories should be placed.
Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight: under 18.5,
normal weight: 18.5 to 25, overweight: 25 to 30, obese: over 30.
